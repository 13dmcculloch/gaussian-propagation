# gaussian-propagation

Simulate the beam waist/bend radius of a Gaussian beam propagating through free space affected by lenses.

## Synopsis
Change beam parameters such as initial wavelength and MFD (which can be calculated analytically) in `beam.json`. Any number of lenses can be specified in `lenses.json`, just add another block with the name of the lens and the parameters.
